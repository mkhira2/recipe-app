# Recipe App

This application allows the user to save and retrieve recipes. My favorite feature allows you to edit your ingredient list and save those ingredients to a shopping list to print to take to the store. I hope you have as much fun exploring and using this application as I had making it. 

This app was written entirely using Angular 4.
